- added check for libxml2-dev in configure.ac (again)

22.01.2010
- completely changed the logic of the rds_encoder, to already output data at the correct rate, thus removing the need for the rational resampler.
- fixed the buffer preparation in the rds_encoder
- removed the freq_statistics code that was temporarily stored here
- fixed compilation with libxml-dev
- corrected fm modulation maximum deviation
- toying around with the rds panel layout

19.11.2009
- added gain range to detect_usrps.py
- renamed grc blocks
- some more cleaning up

14.10.2009
- changed grc blocks installation
- some more cleaning up

16.04.2009
- GRC blocks and rds_tx grc graph
- changed encoder output from char to bool
- separate grc folder with installer script

02.04.2009
- some more cleaning up
- set exact rate conversion for wav file input in usrp_rds_tx
- set audio_rate = usrp_rate in usrp_rds_tx
- add loopback testing python code (for testing w/o USRP)
- draft grc block for rds_encoder

12.03.2009
- fixed interpolating filter in usrp_rds_tx
- some tuning attempts in usrp_rds_rx
- reset rdspanel fields now only when re-tuning

04.03.2009
- upgraded and tested for python2.6
- simplified usrp_rds_tx.py
- added emph tau param to blks2.wfm_rcv_pll in usrp_rds_rx.py
- fixed rds_tx.png
- updated TODO

27.02.2009
- changed rds_data_encoder output from bool to char
- changed the way the 1187.5bps rate is achieved
- replaced bpsk_mod with gr.chunks_to_symbols[1, -1] (NRZ) and a multiplier
- removed the diff_decoder, diff_encoder & bpsk_mod blocks
- removed omnithread dependency

23.02.2009
- corrected the pre-emphasis time constant: 50μsec for EU, 75μsec for US
- added highpass filter for 38kHz stereo carrier (remove 0Hz tone)
- added lowpass filter for 1187.5bps RDS data clock

12.02.2009
- transform_char was equivalent to ASCII, so it was removed
- Minor fixes to AF calculations
- rds_data_encoder now creates group0

07.02.2009
- Added assignment of xml values to variables.

06.02.2009
- Added rds_data_encoder, so far it only parses an XML file

05.02.2009
- Replaced rds.diff_decoder with gr.diff_decoder_bb
- Some more cleaning up

02.02.2009
- Fixed the existing QA code (freq_divider, diff_decoder)
- Added diff_encoder (with QA)
- Renamed biphase_decoder to bpsk_demod

19.12.2008
New features:
- Added mono and stereo FM broadcast python code. Next step: add RDS.

17.10.2008
New features:
- Added display of CT, AF to panel
Miscellaneous:
- Minor bug fixes
- Cleaned up diff decoder

16.10.2008
New features:
- Alternate Frequency (AF) decoding
- Completed the RadioText implementation
- Clocktime (CT) decoding
- Enhanced Other Networks (EON) decoding
Draft features:
- Slow labelling codes (type 1) decoding
- Traffic Message Control (TMC) decoding
Miscellaneous:
- Added lots of comments, matching existing features with their descriptions in the standard(s).
- Several code changes all over the place, to make the code more manageable.

26.07.2008
This code was adobted from Matteo Campanella. It is still available at http://digilander.libero.it/iz2eeq/ It was updated to compile with the latest versions of GnuRadio. Small corrections were made to fix warning messages during compilation. All mc4020-related code was removed.
