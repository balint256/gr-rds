This directory (and the resulting tarball) contains a build tree 
of the RDS (Radio Data System) block for GNU Radio.

This package requires that gnuradio-core is already installed.  It
also depends on some GNU Radio prerequisites, such as boost.

To build the examples use the normal recipe:

  $ mkdir build
  $ cmake ../
  $ make
  $ make install
