1) The script usrp_rds_rx.py is the RDS receiver, which uses rdspanel.py and rdspanel.wxg for the GUI.
2) The script rds_no_gui.py is (obviously) the same receiver, without the GUI (prints everything to the console).
3) The scripts fm_tx_mono.py and fm_tx_stereo.py are FM transmitters taking their input from uncompressed audio files.
4) The script usrp_rds_tx.py is the RDS transmitter, and it's still a work in progress.
